    description: 'A showcase of web component-based applications, including a mind mapping app, a markdown editor, and a shopping cart.',
    detailedDescription: `This project is a showcase of web component-based applications. The showcase is a single-page application that displays a collection of web component apps in a card-based layout. When a card is clicked, the corresponding app is launched in a modal window.

## Key Features

- A collection of web component-based applications, including a mind mapping app, a markdown editor, and a shopping cart.
- A single-page application that displays the apps in a card-based layout.
- A modal window to launch the apps.

## Technical Implementation

- **Web Components**: The project is built using Web Components, a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps.
- **Functional Programming**: Functional programming principles are preferred.
- **BEM CSS**: BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) naming convention is used for CSS classes.

## Development Process

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: TDD is the desired approach.
- **Modular Architecture**: The project follows a modular architecture, with each app built as a self-contained web component.
- **Web Components**: Web Components are the primary design pattern used for building the applications.`,
