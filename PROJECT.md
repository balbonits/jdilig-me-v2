## ðŸš€ **Project Overview**

This project represents a complete rebuild of my personal website with a focus on modern web development practices, accessibility, and performance. It serves as both a portfolio showcase and a demonstration of advanced React/Next.js development techniques.

### **Key Innovations**

1. **Automated Project Management System**: Built a complete workflow for adding projects with just image uploads and JSON data
2. **Advanced Component Architecture**: Modular, reusable UI components following consistent patterns
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Multi-layered testing strategy with unit, E2E, and visual regression tests
4. **Accessibility First**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance built from the ground up
5. **Performance Optimized**: Static site generation with optimized images and code splitting

### **Technical Achievements**


### **For Future AI Assistants**
Each project is now stored as a TypeScript file in the `projects/` directory, exporting a typed `ProjectData` object. See README.md for example and migration notes.
This project serves as a template for future Claude-assisted development projects. The JSON structure above can be used as a reference for documenting similar projects, providing consistent formatting and comprehensive coverage of technical details, challenges, and achievements.
