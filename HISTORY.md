## [2025-08-12] E2E Playwright Test Policy Update
- E2E Playwright test failures (including visual snapshot mismatches) are now considered build-blocking.
- Snapshots must be updated and validated as part of the commit-essential workflow.
- This policy ensures UI/data issues (like the Projects page data bug) are caught before deploy.
# August 2025
- Implemented custom favicon and app icons using /public/images/favicon (multi-size PNG, ICO, Apple touch, manifest)
- Added Playwright E2E test to verify favicon and app icon links in <head>
# August 12, 2025
- Added SEOHead to Utilities and Exercises pages to ensure correct page titles and meta tags (fixes E2E Playwright failures)
- Split Playwright E2E tests into individual page/component spec files
- Cleaned up obsolete E2E spec files and snapshots
- All tests (lint, unit, E2E, build) passing except for minor snapshot diffs
# [2025-08-12]
- Refactored utility data: split into summary index and per-utility JSON files to resolve Next.js large page data warnings.
- Updated Utility Code Showcase: usage examples now use a 2-column grid and open in a modal for better readability.
- Added unified `test:all` script to run Jest and Playwright together.
- Installed Playwright browsers for E2E testing.
- Clarified and documented the full commit/test/documentation workflow in CLAUDE.md and README.md.

## January 2025

### Critical Bug Resolution & Rebuild
- **Infinite Refresh Bug Investigation**: Resolved React dependency loop causing development server instability
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Complex React patterns causing hydration mismatches and dependency loops
- **Systematic Rebuild**: Clean rebuild with basic functionality and stable patterns
- **Debugging Methodology**: Git-based testing, incremental rebuilding, cache clearing, debug logging

### ResumeDisplay Design System Integration
- **Problem Resolution**: Fixed inconsistent styling across showcase pages using inline styles
- **Design Pattern Integration**: Applied ResumeDisplay styling patterns across all components
- **CSS Modules Migration**: Replaced all inline styles with proper CSS Modules
- **Classnames Utility Integration**: Upgraded 6 UI components to use `cn()` utility
- **Responsive Grid Layout**: Fixed example cards to use proper Grid + Card components

## December 2024

### Explicit Solution/Tab Naming System
- **Problem**: Multiple exercises had confusing "Standard" tabs from inferred function names
- **Solution**: Implemented explicit solution metadata system for all exercises
- **Technical Changes**: Updated SolutionMetadata interface and build script for explicit `solutions` arrays

- **ExercisesPage**: Grid listing of all coding exercises with preview cards
- **useCodeData**: React hook for fetching exercises.json and utilities.json
- **Type System**: Enhanced ExerciseInput/ExerciseOutput types for complex data structures
- **JSON Generation**: Automated parsing with optimal solution detection algorithm
- **ESLint Compliance**: Fixed all type errors, anonymous exports, React standards

### Architecture Decisions Made
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Using utility-first styling instead of CSS Modules for consistency
- **Modular Components**: Each component follows index.tsx ‚Üí script.tsx pattern
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive grid layouts (1‚Üí2‚Üí3 columns across breakpoints)
- **Tabbed Solutions**: Multiple algorithm approaches with complexity comparison
- **Optimal Detection**: Automatic analysis based on time complexity priority order

## Quality Assurance Standards

### Development Workflow (Critical)
**ALWAYS run this validation sequence BEFORE committing code:**

1. **üîç Lint Check**: `npm run lint` - Zero ESLint warnings or errors
2. **üß™ Unit Tests**: `npm test` - All test suites passing
3. **üèóÔ∏è Build Verification**: `npm run build` - Successful compilation with no errors

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER commit without running all three steps - prevents broken builds in CI/CD**

### Testing Results
- **Unit Tests**: 22/22 tests passing (classnames utility + Card component + data fetchers)
- **Playwright Tests**: Visual regression baselines generated and verified across 5 browser/device combinations
- **Build Process**: Successful compilation with 24+ static pages generated
- **TypeScript**: All type checking passes with proper interfaces throughout
